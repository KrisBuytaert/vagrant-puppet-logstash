Puppet module to test logstash 


Tested on Centos6 


TODO:

- Fix ordering :)   (nothing  a couple of vagrant provisions don't fix..) 
  Actually the provisions aren't doing it right .. 
- Add apache proxy infront 
- Parametrize a bunch of values / classes .. this stuff only works with all services on 1 host right now.
